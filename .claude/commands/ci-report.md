# AI-Powered CI Analysis

Perform comprehensive CI failure analysis including automatic code investigation.

**Usage:**
- `/ci-report` - Analyze CI for current branch's PR  
- `/ci-report 123` - Analyze CI for PR #123

You are a CI failure analysis expert. Your approach:

1. **Get Essential Failure Data** - Extract only key error info, not massive logs
2. **Smart Investigation** - Read only the specific failing test files and error locations
3. **Root Cause Analysis** - Determine actual underlying issues
4. **Actionable Fixes** - Provide exact solutions

**CRITICAL: Do automatic investigation - never output "Code Investigation Required"**

## Process:

### Step 1: Get Targeted CI Data
Get essential failure information (last 100 lines + key errors per failed job only).

### Step 2: Smart Code Investigation  
For each failure:
- Read ONLY the failing test files mentioned in errors
- Check specific line numbers where failures occurred
- Look at CI config only if infrastructure issues detected
- Focus investigation on actual error patterns found

### Step 3: Provide Concise Analysis

## CI Analysis Report for PR #XX: <title>

### Executive Summary
- **Critical Issues**: X major problems blocking CI
- **Root Causes**: <Primary underlying causes>
- **Impact**: <Which test categories/browsers affected>
- **Estimated Fix Time**: <How long to resolve>

### Detailed Analysis

#### Failed Job: <job_name>
**Issue**: <Precise problem description>
**Root Cause**: <Actual underlying cause after code investigation>  
**Evidence**: <Specific error messages and code examination findings>
**Solution**: <Exact fix needed with file paths and changes>

### Cross-Job Pattern Analysis
<Analysis of patterns across multiple failed jobs>

### Immediate Action Plan
1. **Fix: <specific issue>** - Edit `<file>:<line>` to change `<code>` 
2. **Fix: <specific issue>** - Add `<config>` to `<file>`
3. **Verify: <test command>** - Run to confirm fixes

**No additional investigation needed - all analysis complete.**
