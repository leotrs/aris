- img
- heading "Abstract" [level=3]
- img
- paragraph: This paper explores the revolutionary potential of web-native scientific publishing platforms in transforming how research is disseminated, consumed, and validated. We examine the limitations of traditional PDF-based publishing and propose a new paradigm that leverages modern web technologies to create interactive, accessible, and dynamic research documents.
