# Marketing Site Requirements & Implementation Plan

## Academic Insights Integration (NEW PRIORITY)

Based on critical academic feedback, we need to revise our messaging and positioning:

### üéØ Core Positioning Shift
**From**: "Academic Publishing Infrastructure" (too generic)  
**To**: "Write, Review, and Share Research‚ÄîAll in One Place"

**Key Formula**: Aris = Collaborative Preprint Server + Real-time Collaboration + Journal Export

### üìù Immediate Messaging Changes (Phase 1)

#### 1. Homepage Hero Revision
- **Old**: Generic infrastructure messaging
- **New**: "The first platform where your paper lives from first draft to public discussion"
- **Focus**: Integrated workflow, not individual features

#### 2. Replace "ResOps" Terminology ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Problem**: Too Silicon Valley, doesn't resonate with academics
- **Replace with**:
  - "Living Research Documents" ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
  - "Research as Conversation"
  - "From Draft to Discussion"
  - "The Complete Research Workflow"

#### 3. Create "How It Works" Section
Show the complete integrated workflow:
1. **Start Writing**: Import from arXiv/LaTeX, real-time collaboration
2. **Invite Review**: Transparent process with threaded discussions
3. **Share as Preprint**: Publish while review continues
4. **Journal Ready**: Export with complete review history

### üöÄ Critical Feature Additions

#### Infrastructure Integrations (Add to Technical Pages)
- [ ] ORCID authentication and profiles
- [ ] DOI minting partnerships
- [ ] CrossRef integration
- [ ] Export to journal formats

- [ ] Compatible with all journal submission requirements
- [ ] Share immediately while peer review happens

### üìä What We're NOT Doing
- **No popularity metrics**: Focus on quality engagement, not views
- **No "revolutionary" language**: Respect academic culture
- **No journal replacement**: We complement, not compete
- **No AI hype**: Practical tools, not buzzwords
