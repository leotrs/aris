# Aris Landing Page Design Brief

Project Goal: To create a compelling, high-converting landing page for Aris that clearly communicates its unique value proposition, appeals to its target audience, and drives sign-ups for the demo or beta waitlist.

## Overall Aesthetic & Brand Guidelines

* **Human-First, Modern, Scientific:** The design should convey a sense of approachability, innovation, and intellectual rigor.
* **Clean & Intuitive:** Prioritize clarity, ease of navigation, and a sense of visual order.
* **Color Palette:** Utilize the provided CSS variables from the `master.css` file for all colors.
    * `--primary-500` (`#0E9AE9`), `--primary-600` (`#0B7EC2`), `--primary-700` (`#096195`), `--primary-800` (`#07456E`), `--primary-900` (`#0C456E`), `--primary-100` (`#E0F1FE`), `--primary-50` (`#F0F8FF`)
    * `--secondary-500` (`#8B5CF6`), etc. (full secondary palette available in CSS)
    * `--gray-0` (`#FFFFFF`), `--gray-50` (`#FAFAFA`), `--gray-75` (`#F5F7F8`), `--gray-100` (`#EDF0F2`), `--gray-200` (`#E2E6EB`), `--gray-300` (`#C5CBD3`), `--gray-400` (`#A8B2BD`), `--gray-500` (`#8994A1`), `--gray-600` (`#677382`), `--gray-700` (`#475261`), `--gray-800` (`#2E3743`), `--gray-900` (`#1F252D`)
* **Typography:**
    * Headings (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, etc.): **Montserrat** (bold where appropriate for impact).
    * Body Text: **Source Sans 3**.
    * Line Height: Adhere to `--body-line-height` for body text.

## Core Principles for the Designer:

* Human-First Philosophy: The entire page should subtly reinforce this. Think intuitive, approachable, empowering, and focused on the researcher's experience.

* Web-Native & Interactive: Convey that Aris is "beyond PDF." Use visuals that imply dynamism, interactivity, and modern digital experiences.

* Scannability & Clarity: Break up text. Utilize strong visual hierarchy, whitespace, clear headings, bolding, and icons/illustrations. Avoid "walls of text."

* Progression: The page should tell a story, moving from a high-level hook to specific
  problems, solutions, and finally, a clear call to action.


## Component Design Specifications

### Navbar (Header)

* **Height:** Fixed at **64px**.
* **Position:** **Fixed at the top** of the page, always visible on scroll.
* **Transparency Effect:**
    * Starts **transparent** over the Hero section.
    * Transitions smoothly to a **solid background of `var(--surface-page)` (white)** as the user scrolls down past the Hero.
* **Layout:**
    * **Logo:** Aris logo (linking to homepage) on the far left.
    * **Primary Navigation (Left Side):**
        * `About`, `AI Copilot`, `Pricing`, `Resources` (Dropdown: `Documentation`, `Blog`)
    * **Utility Links / CTAs (Right Side):**
        * `Login` (text link), `Sign Up` (text link), `Try the Demo` (text link)
* **Mobile:** Will collapse into a hamburger menu (standard mobile behavior).

## Landing Page Sections & Content Outline:

### 1. Hero Section

* **Purpose:** Immediate hook, clearly state what Aris is and its core philosophy.

* **Design Layout:** Full-width section up to a max-width (e.g., 960px content width), with content **left-aligned**.
* **Background:** White or a very light gray from the palette to ensure the visual stands out.

* **Content:**
    * **Headline:** Aris: The Unified Platform for Human-First Scientific Research.
    * **Sub-headline:** Experience an integrated platform for collaborative writing, intelligent peer review, and interactive publishing, making your science more discoverable, understandable, and deeply engaging.
    * **Primary CTA Button:** "Try the Demo" (prominent, `var(--surface-action)` background, `var(--white)` text, larger size, clear hover `var(--surface-action-hover)`).
    * **Secondary CTA Link:** "Or, sign up for the beta waitlist" (text link, subordinate to primary).

* **Visual:** A **static, high-quality illustration/rendering of an Aris manuscript in a layered isometric exploded view**. This visual should convey the core concept of Aris â€“ perhaps showing seamless collaboration, interactive research elements, or a clean, modern UI. Avoid generic stock photos.

### 2. The Research Experience, Reimagined by Aris

* **Purpose:** Acknowledge core problems researchers face and present Aris's high-level solutions.

* **Design Layout:** **2x2 grid of cards** on desktop, stacking vertically on mobile.
* **Background:** `var(--gray-75)` (`#F5F7F8`) to visually separate it from the Hero section.

* **Presentation:** Four distinct "cards" or blocks. Each should feature:
  - A unique, relevant icon or small illustration at the top (**Tabler.io icons** recommended).
  - A bolded sub-heading for the problem statement.
  - Concise problem description (1-2 sentences).
  - Bolded solution statement ("Aris provides..." or "Aris offers...").
  - Concise explanation of the solution (1-3 sentences).

* **Card Design:**
    * **Style:** Clean `var(--surface-page)` (white) background, subtle `var(--shadow-soft)`, thin `var(--border-primary)` border, `8px` `border-radius`.
    * **Padding:** Approximately `2em` (`32px`) all around, possibly `2.5em` (`40px`) vertical.

* Content:
  - Card 1: The Unified Research Environment.
    + Problem: Fragmented tools, lost time, battling software.
    + Aris Solution: Integrated platform, eliminates friction, regains version control,
      focuses on discoveries.

  - Card 2: Clunky Collaboration.
    + Problem: Obscured context, hindered feedback, lack of precision.
    + Aris Solution: Elevates collaboration with intelligent assistance (semantic diffs, AI Copilot inviting human interaction), empowering human agency.

  - Card 3: Peer Review Bottleneck.
    + Problem: Opaque, inefficient, sometimes lacking depth or empathy.
    + Aris Solution: Redefines peer review with built-in, efficient system, AI-powered reviewer recommendations for quality and integrity.

  - Card 4: Impersonal Digital Engagement.
    + Problem: Static articles, limiting engagement, hard to grasp complex concepts, losing personal connection.
    + Aris Solution: Transforms research into dynamic, web-native experiences, making it more discoverable, understandable, and deeply engaging.
